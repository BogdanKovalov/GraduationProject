**Title:Detecting Gravitationally Lensed Quasars in the J-PAS Survey Using Machine Learning**

---

### **1. Introduction**

The J-PAS survey provides a unique opportunity to detect gravitationally lensed quasars (GLQs) due to its extensive multi-filter photometry (54 narrow-band filters) and imaging data. The combination of rich photometric data and high-resolution images allows for the application of advanced machine learning techniques to identify GLQ candidates efficiently.

This plan outlines a modern approach to detect GLQs using a combination of object classification and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The methodology leverages both photometric data for initial classification and imaging data for spatial configuration analysis.
